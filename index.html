        <h2>About Kent</h2>
        <p>
            Kent was a kind, generous soul who touched the lives of everyone he met. He was a loving father, devoted
            family man who will be deeply missed by all who knew him. Kent was a talented cricket player, a dedicated
            herbsman, and a cherished friend to all who knew him. He was always there to lend a helping hand or offer a
            word of encouragement. Kent's legacy will live on in the hearts of those who loved him.
